Hi there, I'm Kristin. I'm a DevOps engineer focused on helping developers safely, reliably, and cost-effectively deploy to the cloud. I'm looking to get better and move faster - maybe you are too. 

My primary professional interests right now are Infrastructure as Code, cloud monitoring, and learning how to effectively test both of those. I'm looking to learn more about continuous deployment, traceability, and AWS data tools in 2022. 

I'm also a firm believer that "glue" work is a vital part of People/Process/Products, and I take effective communication to heart. I sincerely try to write/demo/record documentation that helps developers get on-board and in production faster and with more joy!

I'm <a href="https://software.campspot.com/about" target="_blank">happily employed</a> at the moment, but am actively seeking places to speak publicly throughout Summer and Fall 2022. Please contact me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kristinmariesmith/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> if I can bring value to your event.
