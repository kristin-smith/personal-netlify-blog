# How-to implement Honeycomb's OpenTelemetry collector for metrics

Hello, welcome. Take a deep breath. I know you're excited (I'm excited!) to start cost-effectively sending metrics to Honeycomb. I promise I'll keep the fluff to a minimum.

## Honeycomb Metrics Overview:
Honeycomb metrics are <a href="https://www.honeycomb.io/blog/metrics-ga-announcement-2021/" target="_blank">generally available as of September 8, 2021</a> which means anybody with access to a Prometheus instance and a trial Honeycomb account can now <a href="https://docs.honeycomb.io/getting-data-in/metrics/prometheus/" target="_blank"> explore this powerful feature</a> in under 30 minutes. However, if you're running Honeycomb metrics at scale, the number of metric events flooding into your Honeycomb dataset can pretty quickly chew through your event bucket. Yes, we need to invest real time and real dollars into observability to reap its full benefits. But events can and should also be "worth the calories" (thanks GBBO, I missed you). In other words, if there's a way to get the same data but pay  a little bit less, we should DO THAT.

## Metrics, Money, and Custom Collectors:
Honeycomb's engineering team is in the process of contributing a new time stamp processor to the OpenTelemetry Collector that will help pack more metrics data into the same event. How? In the <a href="https://github.com/honeycombio/opentelemetry-collector-configs/tree/main/timestampprocessor" target="_blank">README.md</a>, there's a very understated one-liner: "The timestamp processor will round all timestamps in metrics streams to the nearest <duration>." Based on conversations with Customer Success, implementing this time stamp processor versus the default time stamp behavior in the OpenTelemetry Collector can reduce the number of events sent by 20-40x. That's a huge cost savings over the course of the year.

So, let's make that happen. It does require a little extra work! But we'll do a step by step guide and you should be on your way.

## The metrics bucket brigade (optional, but helpful for understanding what you're building in your environment):


## Implementation Steps:
<em>Note: I'm going to be running this all on AWS EC2 instances to get started. If you're using a different provider, please make the necessary adjustments, but the basic concepts will still hold up.</em>

<ol>
<li>
### Set up an environment to build the Honeycomb OpenTelemetry collector
 <ol>
    <li>
        Provision an EC2 instance based on AWS's Linux 2 AMI (ami-087c17d1fe01783150)
    </li>
    <li>
```
[ec2-user@builder /home/ec2-user]:
sudo -i
yum update && yum install python3-pip jq
pip3 install yq
## need to install go 1.17 to work with the version 0.35.0 of the opentelemetry-collector-builder
wget https://golang.org/dl/go1.17.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz
sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.17.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
go get https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-builder/releases/download/v0.35.0/opentelemetry-collector-builder_0.35.0_linux_amd64 ~/
cp -r ~/opentelemetry-collector-builder_0.35.0_linux_amd64 /home/ec2-user/.local/bin/opentelemetry-collector-builder
chmod 755 /home/ec2-user/.local/bin/opentelemetry-collector-builder
```
  </li>
  <li>
Validate our dependencies
```
go version ## should be 1.17.0
which opentelemetry-collector-builder
```
  </li>
</ol>
<li>
### Build the collector using Honeycomb's recommended configuration
<ol>
<li>
```
[ec2-user@builder /home/ec2-user] sudo -i
cd ./opentelemetry-collector-builder && vi .otelcol-builder.yaml
```
</li>
<li>
Your .otelcol-builder.yaml will just use the Honeycomb recommended config, including Honeycomb's custom timestampprocessor (which will compact our events)
```
dist:
  module: github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-builder
  include_core: true
  otelcol_version: "0.30.0"
processors:
  - gomod: "github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/processor/metricstransformprocessor v0.30.0"
  - gomod: "github.com/honeycombio/opentelemetry-collector-configs/timestampprocessor v0.1.0"
```
</li>
<li>
Build the actual collector for export into your collector instance
 ```.
/opentelemetry-collector-builder --config ~/opentelemetry-collector-builder/.otelcol-builder.yaml  --name honeycomb-otel-metrics-collector
```
</li>
</ol>

<li>
### Set up an opentelemetry collector instance
<ol>
    <li>
        Provision an EC2 instance based on AWS's Linux 2 AMI (ami-087c17d1fe01783150)
    </li>
    <li>
        Install dependencies (systemctl) and the otel-collector RPM from the OpenTelemetry repository
```
[ec2-user@collector /home/ec2-user]:
sudo -i
yum update && yum -y install wget systemctl

wget https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/releases/download/v0.32.0/otel-collector-0.32.0-1.x86_64.rpm
rpm -ivh otel-collector-0.32.0-1.x86_64.rpm
vi /etc/otel-collector/config.yaml <sample config - point to relabeling post>
```
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
### Transfer the opentelemetry collector to the collector instance
You've got options - choose whatever makes sense for your workflow (S3 transfer, scp, etc)
</li>
<li>
### Update the collector service startup script
Update the startup script that comes with the RPM to use the custom OpenTelemetry Collector we built in the last section. ExecStart should point at your custom collector (e.g. "ExecStart=/usr/bin/honeycomb-otel-metrics-collector")
```
vi /usr/lib/systemd/system/otel-collector.service
```
</li>
<li>
### Start the instance/check health and validate metrics in your dataset
<em>on the collector instance</em>
sudo systemctl stop otel-collector
sudo systemctl status otel-collector
Check on your dataset in Honeycomb.io - hopefully you're seeing data coming in.
It will be spiky! Check out these tips for <a href="https://docs.honeycomb.io/getting-data-in/metrics/#step-2-query-your-metric-data" target="_blank">smoothing out your query view</a>.
