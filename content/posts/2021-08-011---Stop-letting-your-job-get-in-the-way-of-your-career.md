# Is focusing so hard on your job distracting you from professional development?

<em>“What are your goals before we meet again in August?”</em>

Oh no.

I sat anxiously awaiting the moment the facilitator would call my name and I would have to unmute myself on Zoom to answer. I hadn’t done either of the two things I had enthusiastically “committed” to doing for this call, right here, today. How was I going to catch up, much less take on new tasks?

This was a mentorship call focused on women in technical roles trying to level up out of our current roles and establish ourselves professionally – I WANTED to be here, taking full advantage of this opportunity and yet I wasn’t.

By the time I clicked the button to speak, I already knew the answer was to shift my priorities in a subtle but important way. And so I opened with the truth:

<em>“I have to stop letting my job get in the way of my career.”</em>

(Followed by some actual concrete tasks, of course!)

To be <em>very clear</em>, I truly enjoy where I work right now. But, I’d been letting other priorities steal my after-hours time and drain my energy because I mistakenly believed they would help me build my career. I needed to shift from fighting fires and closing tickets (things that are rewarded in my job) to developing my communication style and preparing a foundation to move into people management (things that I need to advance in my career, well after my time in this role will inevitably end).

I remember watching Camille Fournier say in an interview that she didn’t really do side projects because she was always more interested in solving the problem in front of her. This was so incredibly validating as someone who likes to use my job and its challenges as a focal point around which I can grow professionally. I struggle with investing time and energy into other technical projects without feeling guilty for not using that time to advance my team.

But jobs are in flux. Even the best teams experience turnover. New opportunities arise. Exclusively orienting personal professional development around your current role may not ultimately serve your long-term career goals.

# Ways you might be prioritizing your job over your career:

## You unintentionally let your day job bleed over into the time you meant to spend on your personal development

Do you plan to work on your portfolio, or that self-paced course, or the blog post after work but then find yourself answering one last email or reviewing on more PR and poof that time has vanished? I did (do?) this. In the spirit of “breaking things into bite-sized chunks”, I scheduled professional development time in 30 minute intervals that disappeared into thin air every time a 5:45pm Slack message came in. Especially in distributed teams where other people may be working later than you plan to, it’s so easy to give up that time to take care of one more thing, unblock one more person. I enjoy my job and close collaboration with my teammates (and newer hires in particular), but constantly negating my own self-development serves no one.

## You exhaust your mental energy before you tackle your personal projects

Trick, tricky.

I find that different types of personal development pull down from different stores of mental energy. Networking requires lightness, emotional energy, and a pep talk (I’m a true introvert who loves connecting but dreads introductory meetings) so for me, I have to balance where else I spend those resources in order to retain any for meeting new professional connections. In my previous role, it was rare that I drained my social energy in my day job but as I move into team leadership, 1:1’s will use the majority of this pool. I anticipate needing to coordinate networking events for days when I haven’t already used all my social spoons.

Moreover, other types of professional development do pull power from the same energy pool that I use to do well in the technical parts of my job. This pool can be easily depleted and without rationing, I’ve got nothing left over for tackling more screen-time, hands-in-the-terminal work that I want to do to continue building a skill.

## You plan all your training or development work around problems you face in your current role

Take a quick review of the after-hours courses, reading, and practice you’ve done over the last six months. Were all of those directly tied to your current role? There’s absolutely nothing wrong with solving the problem in front of you and building confidence in your role, but if 0% of your training helps you build skills for the future you don’t know yet, you’ll always be reacting.

For most of us, our current roles only contain a subset of the skills we need to stay competitive. Personal professional development time is about working on the other subset, the group of skills and qualities that we want to use in the future. Additionally, technical expertise changes so rapidly that only training to the tools and technologies your current day job uses leaves us unprepared for future opportunities.

# Shifting your priorities:
## If you need to protect your <em>TIME</em>:
* Evaluate your WHEN

In a perfect world, yes, you could shut off your work email/Slack/etc at some predetermined time on any given day and immediately shift to your own work. That’s often not realistic – there’s a production issue you’re involved with, you promised something by EOD that’s blocking the rest of your team and cannot be delegated on such short notice, etc. (Also, shoutout to anyone who is also dealing with household situations where caretaking responsibilities immediately take over when you shut your laptop).

In this imperfect world, are there still times in your week that feel more predictable? I find that morning before work starts (ideally before anyone else wakes up) can be the most productive as long as I know exactly what I’m trying to work on. Monday evenings tend to be the quietest in my current role, so I batch longer work sessions on those days rather than trying to evenly portion out small pieces throughout the week.


* Create GOALPOSTS

Seek opportunities with deadlines (or create artificial ones if you need to!). This is one of the easiest ways to trick yourself into shifting your priority from time-sucking tasks to the goal that must be done by X date.

Artificial deadlines could include:
    <ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Scheduling a LinkedIn post about the work you want to have completed. If it makes sense for your brand, a teaser post might be appropriate too: “I’m finishing up the touches on a new project – can’t wait to share it with you next week” will motivate me way more than my day planner!</li>
      <li>Tying a professional development project to quarterly evaluations</li>
      <li>My favorite! Scheduling a trip or another reward time and then orienting your efforts to finish the task so you can relax and enjoy it</li>
    </ul>
    </ul>

* Long term – stop being such a bottleneck!

If last minute requests for your time and input result in you extending your workday earlier, later, and sideways, you may be a bottleneck. What foundational training, documentation, or coaching could help your team answer more of their own questions and resolve more fires on their own? And then, because often the time needed to make those resources is it’s own blocker, can any of that be outsourced? This situation came up recently and caused a sizable delay until the senior engineer realized he didn’t have to create his own training program – it was actually cheaper and faster to put everyone through the same MOOC course on a particular technical component and then have the engineers write up the plan for how to implement within the company.

## If you need to expand the Content or Scope of your training and development:
Identify two learning areas (maybe one technical and one leadership) that you see as totally unrelated to your current role. Focus on identifying relatively small training investments that would help you gain a broader understanding of the topic. 

For example, maybe your company is working in a hybrid model with some on-premise resources and some cloud resources, but your team is specifically on-premise. Knowing more about cloud resources and cloud-native development will almost certainly come in handy one day, but jumping into getting multiple cloud certifications is a big investment (unless you’re actively trying to make a career switch in which case – go for it!). 

On the other hand, taking a course on the business reasons for switching to cloud and doing a tutorial on serverless computing with a free AWS account can provide context, improve your understanding of the pros and cons, and teach you a new skill you could brush up on if that opportunity arose.

## This is within your control - and it benefits more than just you

To re-iterate, job stresses are seductive in their urgency and importance. But they are temporary. The current situation will pass, new people will join and beloved colleagues will move on to other opportunities. Companies will be bought and sold.

ne way of phrasing my career goals is that I always want choice - choice of what team to be on, choice of where I get to live, freedom and flexibility to also pursue my other interests and callings. Professional development keeps me competitive and able to negotiate those choices. 

THIS CAN FEEL VERY SELFISH! However, the parallel benefit to me working on my professional future is almost always that my current team benefits. Learning new tehnologies, approaches, communication tactics, etc positively spill over into my role and tend to draw from broader sources than the things I learn when I focus exclusively on my day job. PProfessional development is therefore mutually beneficial to my future and present selves and colleagues.

Even if it doesn't feel like it every day -- because some forces are legitimately outside our control and some days it feels like taking two hours at night to not be in the queue is "bad" -- we can work towards feeling this balance more days than not.

### P.S.
If you’re really into parallel structure in posts, you’ll already have noticed I offered no concrete steps on guarding your energy. This is going to be a big area of focus for me in 2021, so I’ll hold off on any advice until I feel I’ve taken big concepts and figured out how to work them into my life. If you have any suggestions (personal practices, resources, inspiring people), please let me know in the comments!
